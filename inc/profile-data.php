    "description" => "Originally from Holland, Michigan, Skyler currently lives in Chicago, Illinois, where he works in higher education. Skyler has been playing music for years, and got his start on drums when he was 6 years old. He started playing in church when he was 9, and music has been his biggest passion ever since! Skyler was the Music Director at New Vision Church in Holland, Michigan for 4 years, followed by a 2 year stint playing at Central Wesleyan Church, and is currently a band leader at Community Christian Church in Lincoln Park. When he’s rocking out with NSF, you’ll usually see him on keys and vocals, or dropping a freestyle rap. When he’s not singing his little heart out, he’s probably going for a long run along the lakefront, watching King of Queens, checking out a new brewery, or exploring the city he loves with friends."

    "description" => "Born and raised in Zeeland, Michigan, Nikki has been singing ever since she can remember. She got her start performing at local churches with her family and added violin to the mix when she started playing at age 10. Nikki has been extremely involved in leading worship at Central Wesleyan Church for over a decade, in a killer string quartet for 4 years, and she led Spring Arbor University's chapel band for 3 semesters while she was a student there. While music is Nikki's creative outlet, she spends most of her time nursing people back to health as a RN in the Emergency Department. If she's not singing, playing, or working, you'll find her kickin' it with her family and friends poolside or at the beach, discovering a new Jillian Michael's workout video, or catching up on the latest Netflix trend.",

She started playing piano at age 8, the french horn at age 11, and joined the show choir in high school. Emily participated in the Spring Arbor University Chamber Singers and Concert Choir for two of her years there, and was a member of the SAU Chapel Band for two and a half years, leading them for her last year and a half. She is currently involved in the worship team at Redemption Church in Grandville. When Emily's not making music, she can be found teaching high school Spanish, sunbathing at the beach or pool with family and friends, watching sports with her husband, or playing in the backyard with her little girl."
